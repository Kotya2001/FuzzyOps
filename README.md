# FuzzyOps
Library of algorithms for fuzzy forecasting and decision support

The library is intended for use:
- in scientific laboratories engaged in research in the field of multi-criteria analysis, optimal planning and management;
- in companies engaged in the development of decision support systems. In fact, the library should be used in the creation of both full-featured software products and experimental mock-ups of software systems designed to work with fuzzy factors.

The library can also be used by directly calling functions in C++ programs, following the instructions:
- https://github.com/Kotya2001/FuzzyOps/blob/main/cpp/README.md

It is also possible to implement a RESTful API in your software (the web service is deployed on your own resources), following these instructions:
 * https://github.com/Kotya2001/FuzzyOps-App - the source code of the web service for deployment;
 * https://github.com/Kotya2001/FuzzyOps-App/tree/main/posters - examples for accessing a web service via API (implemented in Python);
 * https://github.com/Kotya2001/FuzzyOps-App/wiki/Инструкция-по-использованию-алгоритмов-в-веб%E2%80%90серсиве-(по-API) - Instructions for using the library's algorithms through the RESTful API.


### How to install the library

To install the library as a pip package, use
the command: `pip install git+https://{login}:{token}@github.com/Kotya2001/FuzzyOps.git `
by substituting the appropriate values:

 - login: your login on GitHub
